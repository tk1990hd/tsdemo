Feature: Visitor default search

Background:
Given the user is not logged in
And there are at least 19 items under $100

Scenario Outline: Default search results are fully working for a visitor
When I open the homepage
Then I see at least 9 product cards
And the pagination control shows at least 3 selectable pages
When I navigate to the <paginationLocation> page via the pagination control
Then I see at least <itemCount> items
And each visible product card shows a title, image, and price
When I open the <itemLocation> item
Then I land on a product details page
And the details page shows a title, primary image, and price

Examples:
| paginationLocation | itemCount | itemLocation
| First | 9 | First
| Middle | 9 | Middle
| Last | 1 | Last
